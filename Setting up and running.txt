===================================Setting up and Running the Project==================================================

1. Open Eclipse -> File-> Open projects from file system ->
 -> Navigate to this folder and choose RateLimiter.
2. I created some classes for demonstration and testing purposes.
“TestRun.java“ will be the entry point for testing the application.
There are variables provided in that class that you can configure for simulating
the API requests.


NOTE: I only included comments wherever we felt it’s necessary.
For more detailed information about each class and its methods, Please open
“allclasses-index.html” present in the “Javadoc” folder. From there you can click
on each class and navigate to their respective documentation.

For a general overview of how the project works, please read pages 2 and 3 of
the Report.

====================================Application Work Flow==========================================================
1. First we create a manager instance and add user “abhi” and an API “/dev”.
2. User object with ID as “abhi” will be created and added in the manager object
and an API with ID “/dev” will be added to the API Index.
3. When we call the requested method of manager instance, it will identify the
User with the ID and passes the request to it.
4. when the user object receives the request it looks for the API mentioned.
5. Since we didn’t explicitly add an API in our user object for tracking, it looks in
the API index.
6. The API will be present in the API index, so the user object will add the API with
the default limit and start tracking.
7. The request will be sent to the newly added API object.
8. The API will calculate the requests and compares them with the limit and
Since the limit is not exceeded it gives the status to the throttle object and calls
the “notExceeded” method in the throttle.
